let data = [
    ['Color', 'hex', 'Description'],
    ['Green', '#008000', `Seeing the colour green has been linked to more creative thinking—so greens are good options for home offices, art studios, etc.`],
    ['Violet', '#0000FF', `People link a greyish violet with sophistication, so it can be a good selection for places where you’re trying to make the “right” impression.`],
    ['Blue', '#EE82EE', `People are more likely to tell you that blue is their favourite colour than any other shade. That makes it a safe choice.`]];
